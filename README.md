# IMDbTestAutomation

The project contains a few UI tests written with Selenium WebDriver (requires Firefox installation) to test IMDb Top 250 page funtionality.
You can run the test from the command line as java -jar Top250Test.jar (make sure you switch (cd) to the project directory before running the jar command).

Or view the source code by importing the project in your IDE (I used Eclipse with Gradle plugin. Gradle wrapper will download the gradle 2.4 version, so you do not need to have it installed on your machine).

You could also compile the dependencies for this project from the command line. Switch to the project root directory and type the command 'gradlew compileJava'.
